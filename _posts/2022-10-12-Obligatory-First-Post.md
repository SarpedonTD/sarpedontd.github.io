## Obligatory First Post

For almost as long as I've been playing video games I've also been writing hobby software to assist me or my friends in those games.

One of my more recent projects is a tournament bot, Legion, used to run tournaments on Discord for the mobile version of C&C: Command & Conquer: Rivals.
Rivals is how I met JadeXyan (co-creator of Legion),  and Captain Benzie. That set off a chain of unfortunate events that led to me becoming one of the executors of an alliance in Eve Echoes: The VOID Federation. 

As part of VOID the software projects include:
* Working on a team to maintain a credit system for the alliance members: [www.voidcoin.app](www.voidcoin.app).
* Creating another bot with JadeXyan caled Orphyx to maintain in-game character information for the 1000+ members of VOID.

This is the first time I've created a blog. Though I've often wanted to create a blog, or a software blog. What has stopped me is I've never felt I had anything to write about. The blog itself a bit of learning for me. It was quickly created using github pages as well as the template and steps found here:

I'll be writing about these projects and delving into the technical details of them in this blog.

But really, the idea is to create semi-regular content as a way to shamelessly plug my buymeacoffee site. This is then used to then pay for the various tech tools of my current alliance, VOID.
